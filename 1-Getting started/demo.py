Variables: Name of a variable can be combination of letters, digits and '_'. Always make meaningful named variables.
But they never start with digits. Also the type of the variable is maintained dynamically.
This makes python a loosely typed language.
Also we need to initialize the variables when they are first declared.
Need to be careful about the current type of data variable in use points to, or it can cause confusion and errors.
